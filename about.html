                2015–2016: Early Days
                The first incarnation of the group had the Guico twins and Ben Sasis but the latter 
                left the band around 2015 to pursue his BMX career. The Guico twins came up with the name 
                "Ben, Ben & Ben" but later changed it to The Benjamins due to lack of impact. 
                They wrote their first song "Ultimate" during their college days. Unfortunately, 
                there are no record to be found of this song.
